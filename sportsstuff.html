	<h1>Boston Sports</h1>
	<p>The landing page of my application will have a signup/login button along with
	   4 icons, one of each of the sports teams in Boston (Patriots, Bruins, Celtics, and Red Sox). When a user clicks on one
	   of those buttons, they will go to a page that has that teams' sports accessories. A
	   user can then select the items that they want and put them into a bag. Each user
	   can save bags of sports items for later. The user will also be able to purchase the
	   items from amazon.com once they have a bag of the stuff.
      </p>

       <p>This site will have the following features</p>
       <ul>
	     <li>It will be built on the full Kohana framework</li>
	     <br>
	     <li>After a user selects the amount of a certain item that they want, they will be able to drag the items to the bag</li>
	     <br>
	     <li>The system will be tapped into the amazon API and live, so a user would be able to ACTUALLY purchase the items they select if they like</li>
      </ul>

    <p>I guess any ecommerce site is similar in functionality to this one so i'll name some that I found to be inspirational
    in the design of this project:</p>

    <ul>
		     <li><a href="http://givingsomething.com">Giving Something</a> - this site is absolutely amazing and feature rich and uses the amazon API the way that I want to </li>
		     <br>
		     <li><a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/ ">itunes</a> - yet another beauty, this site has large icons for shopping categories</li>
		     <br>
		     <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/">Amazon</a> I can't use their API without crediting them for inspiration, they complete me</li>
      </ul>
