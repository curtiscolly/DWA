chmod -R 755 DWA
git fetch solves the merge issue
$ git pull --rebase
To pull remote changes before yours, and then commit. And see if it works.

If this does not work, try this instead:

$ git stash
$ git pull --rebase
$ git stash pop

This stuff works if you are not on a branch and need to get on one
git stash
git checkout some-branch
git stash pop

git pull origin master

make it so that you cannot see your own posts

To make this system more secured, we can use a form and use
the type hidden value='11' under the submit button

// This is to check and see what you just dumped from the database
into an array
echo Debug::dump($connections,"connections");

Whatever data we want to use in the view we have to pass it to the view
console.log can be used to echo out variables

JSON is a conveinent way to pass data back and fourth

the login controller is for success or failed logins and p_login is for setting cookies

When you authenticate a user, you return their username.
It is set to global in the base controller

Authenticate looks for a token cookie
