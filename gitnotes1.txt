I have to change permissions every time I do a pull from the git terminal

chmod -R 755 DWA
git fetch solves the merge issue
$ git pull --rebase
To pull remote changes before yours, and then commit. And see if it works.

If this does not work, try this instead:

$ git stash
$ git pull --rebase
$ git stash pop

This stuff works if you are not on a branch and need to get on one
git stash
git checkout some-branch
git stash pop

git pull origin master
